# lz4-beef
A bare minimum lz4 wrapper for the beef language.

# Usage
In order to use this library properly, you must be LZ4 from scratch, attempting to use the release libs is not going to work. I've tried. 
Afterwards, place the libs in the following structure: `../lz4-beef/dist/[OS]-x64/dll` for the *.dll* and `../lz4-beef/dist/[OS]-x64/lib` for the *.lib* file.

# Future Updates
I don't know whether or not I will maintain this library, I only have use for the lz4.c file, nothing else, so there's a possibility that it remain this way. 
**USE KNOWING THIS MAY NOT GET UPDATED**
